## Question 1

> Revisit the marriage, age, and happiness collider bias example from Chapter
6. Run models m6.9 and m6.10 again (pages 178â€“179). Compare these two models
using both PSIS and WAIC. Which model is expected to make better predictions,
according to these criteria, and which model yields the correct causal
inference?
