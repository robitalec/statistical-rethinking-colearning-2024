## Setup

```{r}
#| include: false
targets::tar_source('R')
```


```{r}
#| eval: false
targets::tar_source('R')
```


## Question 1

> Revisit the marriage, age, and happiness collider bias example from Chapter
6. Run models m6.9 and m6.10 again (pages 178–179). Compare these two models
using both PSIS and WAIC. Which model is expected to make better predictions,
according to these criteria, and which model yields the correct causal
inference?


```{r}

```


## Question 2

> Reconsider the urban fox analysis from last week’s homework. On the basis
of PSIS and WAIC scores, which combination of variables best predicts body
weight (W, weight)? What causal interpretation can you assign each coefficient
(parameter) from the best scoring model?
