## Setup

```{r}
#| include: false
targets::tar_source('R')
```


```{r}
#| eval: false
targets::tar_source('R')
```


## Question 1

> Conduct a prior predictive simulation for the Reedfrog model. By this I mean
to simulate the prior distribution of tank survival probabilities. Start by
using this prior:

$$\alpha_{j} \sim Normal(\bar{\alpha}, \sigma)$$
$$\bar{alpha} \sim Normal(0, 1)$$
$$\sigma \sim Exponential(1)$$

> Be sure to transform the alpha j values to the probability scale for plotting
and summary. How does increasing the width of the prior on sigma change the
prior distribution of alpha j? You might try Exponential(10) and
Exponential(0.1) for example.
