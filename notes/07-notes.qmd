Occam's razor is often mentioned as a recommendation to select the simplest
explanation of some process. Usually however, there isn't a set of comparably
accurate models where one is more complicated than the other. Instead, 
the trade off is between simplicity and accuracy. 

Problems of prediction:

1. What function describes these points? (fitting a line)
1. What function explains these points? (causal inference)
1. What would happen if we changed a point's mass? (intervention)
1. What is the next observation from the same process? (prediction without intervention)
