# Generalized linear models

Linear models: expected value is an additive combination  of 
parameters

$$Y_{i} \sim Normal(\mu_{i}, \sigma)$$
$$\mu_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{Z} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i}$$

Generalized linear models: expected value is **some function** of an additive
combination of parameters

$$Y_{i} \sim Bernoulli(p_{i})$$
$$f(p_{i}) = \alpha + \beta_{Z} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i}$$
- $Y_{i}$: 0/1 outcome
- $p_{i}$: probability of event
- $f(p_{i})$: f() maps probability scale to linear model scale
- $\alpha + \beta_{{X}} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i})$: can be any real value


In generalized linear models, all parameters interact because the 
outcome is bounded. Gaussian models are the only type of model where
this is not true since the outcome is unbounded. 


## Distributions

Distributions are matched to the constraints on observed variables. 
The link function is matched to this distribution.

- Exponential distribution: time to event that has a constant rate. 
Greater than 0, single parameter $\lambda$ that defines the rate.
- Binomial distribution: count events bounded in an observation window. 
eg. some number of trials
- Poisson distribution: count events with constant rate. This is the count 
distribution of the exponentially distributed events. We don't know the maximum 
or number of coin tosses.
- Gamma distribution: sum up exponential processes.
- Normal distribution: Gamma distribution with large mean converges to the 
Normal distribution. 

Distribution you want to use to model an observed variable is governed by the 
constraints on observation. Eg. you can't have negative counts. You can't use 
some test to decide if your data are "Normal". 

## Modeling events

> Like tide prediction engines (analog computers), the gears inside the machine
bear no resemblance to the observable predictions that they output

- Events are discrete, unordered outcomes
- Observations are counts of events
- Estimates are on the probability or log-odds/logit scale 

These estimates are bounded,  eg. the probability of an event is restricted
to 0-1. 


Two options, that are equivalent for inference: 

- Logistic regression: binary [0,1] outcome and logit link, with Bernoulli
distribution
- Binomial regression: count [0, N] outcome and logit link, with Binomial
distribution. Binomial variables are sums of Bernoulli variables. 



## Logit link

Bernoulli and binomial models most often use the logit link. 

$logit$ is the link function

$logit(p_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{{X}} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i})$

$logit^{-1}$ (logistic) is the inverse link function. 

$p_{i} = logit^{-1}(\alpha + \beta_{{X}} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i})$


Logit link is a harsh transformation


```{r}
p <- seq(0, 1, 0.01)

ggplot(data.table(logit_p= logit(p), p = p)) + geom_line(aes(logit_p, p))

```


## Logistic priors

The logit link compresses parameter distributions. Anything above +4 = almost
always, anything below -4 = almost never.

## Example: UC Berkeley Admissions

- Graduate school applications for 1973 UC Berkeley
- Stratified by department and gender of application

### 1. Estimand


```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggdag))
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('G', 'D', 'A', 'G_star', 'R', 'U'),
	x =    c(1,    2,   3,   2,         4,   4),
	y =    c(0,    1,   0,  -1,        -1,   1)
)
```

Is there gender discrimination in graduate admissions?

```{r}
dagify(
	A ~ G,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


- G: gender
- A: admission

```{r}
dagify(
	D ~ G,
  A ~ D,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```

- D: department

Typically, department is considered a mediating variable. Departments differ
in their number of applicants, number of accepted students, potential 
differences in applicants and acceptance by gender, etc

What does the "causal effect of gender" mean?

Really this is another variable - the perceived gender G*. 

```{r}
dagify(
	A ~ R + G_star + D,
	G_star ~ G,
	D ~ G,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


Which path represents "discrimination"?

- direct discrimination: status-based discrimination from G -> A. Requires
strong assumptions. 
- structural discrimination: indirect through department G -> D -> A. Requires
strong assumptions. 
- total discrimination: G -> A and G -> D -> A, in other words: 
what an individuals experience. Requires mild assumptions. 

These three types of discrimination require different estimators. 


### 2. Generative model


- Set number of applicants
- Sample gender
- Sampled with preference for different departments by gender (indirect effect)
- Define acceptance rate for departments
- Simulate acceptance


Changing the acceptance rate where acceptance differs by department **and** gender, 
pattern of differences in acceptance rates is the same in this simulated data. 
This illustrates the fundamental problem of determining if discrimination is
occurring. 

Generative model could be greatly improved:

- Admission rates depend upon size of applicant pool and the distribution
of qualifications
- Admission rates are then based on ranking applicants to a set number of spaces

### 3. Statistical models

Total causal effect of G

$A_{i} \sim Bernoulli(p_{i})$

$logit(p_{i}) = \alpha[G_{i}]$

$\alpha = [\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}]$


Direct causal effect of G

$A_{i} \sim Bernoulli(p_{i})$

$logit(p_{i}) = \alpha[G_{i}, D_{i}]$

$\alpha = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_{1, 1} & \alpha_{1, 2} \\ \alpha_{2, 1} & \alpha_{2, 2}\end{bmatrix}$


### 4. Validate the model

Use inverse logit function to transform variables back on probability scale.
Determine if known parameters are recovered by the model. 


### 5. Analyze the data

To use a binomial distribution, aggregate the long format data into acceptance
sums for each gender and department. This is equivalent to using the original
data with a Bernoulli distribution.

- inspect trace plots and trank plots to ensure chains are well mixed
- extract samples from the posterior
- convert the entire posterior distribution back to the prediction scale with 
the inverse logit 
- compute contrasts for total effect (across genders) and direct effects
(within departments)


#### Post stratification

Back to the question: what's the average direct effect of gender across
departments?

This depends on the perception of gender on the admission officer

```{r}
dagify(
	A ~ G_star + D,
	G_star ~ G,
	D ~ G,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```

To calculate the causal effect of G*, we must average (marginalize) over the
departments. Process: simulate as if all applicants are women, then simulate as
if all applicants are men. Then compute the contrasts.

Post stratification is re-weighting estimates for a specific target population.
Eg. at a different university, the distributions would differ, and we could
predict how the consequences of intervention differ


### Survival analysis

How long did an event take to happen? Time-to-event. 

Cannot ignore censored cases, where event never happened. 

- Left-censored: don't know when time started
- Right-censored: observation ended before event

#### Example: cat adoptions

Adoption rates of black and non-black cats

Events: adopted, or something else (death, escape, censored)


Outcome variables: days to event. Appropriate distributions are exponential
and gamma. Exponential arises from a single part that needs to fail before 
the so-called machine dies, whereas the Gamma distribution requires
multiple parts to fail. 


For simplest situation, time to adoption, this represents it:

$D_{i} \sim Exponential(\lambda_{i})$

$p(D_{i} | \lambda_{i}) = \lambda_{i} exp(-\lambda_{i} D_{i})$


But what about the censored cats?

Event happened = cumulative distribution, probability of event happening
up to time x

Event didn't happen = complementary cumulative distribution, probability
event hasn't occurred up to time x


$D_{i} = 1 \sim Exponential(\lambda_{i})$

$D_{i} = 0 \sim Exponential-CCDF(\lambda_{i})$ (not-yet-adoptions)

$\lambda_{i} = 1 / \mu_{i}$

$log \mu_{i} = \alpha_{CID[i]}$ 


- $D_{i} = 1$: observed adoptions
- $D_{i} = 0$: not yet adoptions
