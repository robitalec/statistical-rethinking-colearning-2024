# Ordered categorical

Ordered categorical variables are discrete types with ordered relationships. 

- not a count variable, not continuous
- bounded between min, max (eg. Trolley 1-7)
- eg. good, bad, excellent - not "cat, dog, chicken"
- distances between categories  is not known or the same
- often there are "anchor points" and not everyone shares the same anchor 
point


Modeling an ordered categorical requires converting the orders to cumulative
frequency. Instead of the probability of 5 out of 10, we have the probability
of 5 or less out of 10.

Recall, cumulative log-odds is the log of the probability of x occurring divided
by the probability of x not occurring.

Now we are estimating cutpoints. The number of cutpoints we estimate
is the number of categories - 1, since the cumulative probability of the 
last category is the total cumulative probability. 

Then estimating the probability of a specific category is 
the probability of all categories up to that category subtracting the 
probability of all categories up to the preceding category. 

To make it a function of the variables, either by stratifying the cutpoints
or by offsetting each cutpoint by the value of a linear model $\phi$.

$\phi_{i} = \beta x_{i}$

$log \frac{Pr(R_{i} <= k)}{1-Pr(R_{i} <= k)} = \alpha_{k} + \phi_{i}$

$R_{i} \sim OrderedLogit(\phi_{i}, \alpha)$
