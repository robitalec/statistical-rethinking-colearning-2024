# Ordered categorical

Ordered categorical variables are discrete types with ordered relationships. 

- not a count variable, not continuous
- bounded between min, max (eg. Trolley 1-7)
- eg. good, bad, excellent - not "cat, dog, chicken"
- distances between categories  is not known or the same
- often there are "anchor points" and not everyone shares the same anchor 
point


Modeling an ordered categorical requires converting the orders to cumulative
frequency. Instead of the probability of 5 out of 10, we have the probability
of 5 or less out of 10. 

![](../graphics/stat_rethinking_l11_slide32.png)
Recall, cumulative log-odds is the log of the probability of x occurring divided
by the probability of x not occurring.

Now we are estimating cutpoints. The number of cutpoints we estimate
is the number of categories - 1, since the cumulative probability of the 
last category is the total cumulative probability. 

Then estimating the probability of a specific category is 
the probability of all categories up to that category subtracting the 
probability of all categories up to the preceding category. 

To make it a function of the variables, either by stratifying the cutpoints
or by offsetting each cutpoint by the value of a linear model $\phi$.

$\phi_{i} = \beta x_{i}$

$log \frac{Pr(R_{i} <= k)}{1-Pr(R_{i} <= k)} = \alpha_{k} + \phi_{i}$

$R_{i} \sim OrderedLogit(\phi_{i}, \alpha)$


## Example: Trolley problem

- Runaway trolley, actor standing next to a switch
- If you don't pull the switch, it will strike 5 people on the track
- If you do pull the switch, it will strike 1 person on the track


Scenarios that contain three principles

- Action: taking an action is less morally permissible than not taking an action
- Intention: eg. pulling the lever to strike the 1 person and this stopping the 
trolley - this is necessary and intentional to save the 5 people
- Contact: eg. pushing a large person on the track 

Data:

- 331 individuals
- action, intention, contact
- 30 different trolley problems
- voluntary participation

Response: how appropriate from 1-7


### Estimand

How do action, intention and contact influence response to a trolley story?

```{r}
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('X', 'R', 'S', 'E', 'Y', 'G',  'P'),
	x =    c(1,    2,   3,   1,    2,   3,  2),
	y =    c(0,    0,   0,   -2,  -1,  -2,  -3)
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	R ~ X + S + E + Y + G,
	E ~ Y + G,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


- R: response to the trolley story
- X: action, intention, contact
- S: story
- E: education 
- Y: age
- G: gender



### Initial model

$R_{i} \sim OrderedLogit(\phi_{i}, \alpha)$

$\phi_{i} = \beta_{A}A_{i} + \beta_{C}C_{i} + \beta_{I}I_{i}$

$\beta \sim Normal(0, 0.5)$

$\alpha_{j} \sim Normal(0, 1)$


### Total causal effect of gender

$R_{i} \sim OrderedLogit(\phi_{i}, \alpha)$

$\phi_{i} = \beta_{A}A_{i, G_{i}} + \beta_{C}C_{i, G_{i}} + \beta_{I}I_{i, G_{i}}$

$\beta \sim Normal(0, 0.5)$

$\alpha_{j} \sim Normal(0, 1)$


```{r}
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	R ~ X + S + E + Y + G,
	E ~ Y + G,
	exposure = 'G',
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag_status(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag() + guides(color = 'none')
```


### Endogenous selection

Note - this is a voluntary sample and participation is influenced by
age, education and gender. There is sample selection from this participation
meaning the data is already stratified by the features of the participating population. 

In addition, participation is a collider and conditioning on it makes 
education, gender and age co-vary in the sample. Therefore, we 
cannot estimate the total causal effect of gender. 

```{r}
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	R ~ X + S + E + Y + G,
	E ~ Y + G,
	P ~ E + Y + G,
	exposure = 'P',
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag_status(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + 
	theme_dag() + 
	guides(color = 'none')
```

To get the direct effect of gender, we need to stratify by age and education.
We'll represent education as an ordered monotonic predictors.
