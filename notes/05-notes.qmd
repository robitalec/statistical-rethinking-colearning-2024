# The four elemental confounds

Correlation is common in nature, causation is sparse. 
Causes are not in the data.


![](../graphics/stat_rethinking_l05_four_elemental.png)

Recall: 

- Estimand: goal
- Estimator: recipe, instructions
- Estimate: result, may not always match estimand due to eg. confounds

Confounds are features of the sample and how we use the sample that misleads
us. Sources of confounds are diverse but there are four elemental 
confounds. 


## The fork

```{r}
#| echo: false
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('X', 'Y', 'Z'),
	x =    c(1,    3,   2),
	y =    c(0,    0,   0)
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 2
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	X ~ Z,
	Y ~ Z,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


- X and Y are associated ($Y \not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp X$)
- X and Y share common cause Z
- Once stratified by Z, there will be no association ($Y \perp\!\!\!\perp X | Z$)



$\not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp$: not independent of

$\perp\!\!\!\perp$: independent of

$|$: conditional of



```{r}
n <- 1e3
Z <- rbern(n, 0.5)
X <- rbern(n, (1-Z) * 0.1 + Z * 0.9)
Y <- rbern(n, (1-Z) * 0.1 + Z * 0.9)

table(X, Y)
cor(X, Y)
```


### Example: marriage and divorce


#### Estimand

Why do regions of the USA with higher rates of marriage also have higher
rates of divorce?


#### Scientific model

Age at marriage is also associated with divorce and marriage rates. 
Is the relationship between marriage rate and divorce rate solely
a result of the fork, their shared relationship with age at marriage? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('M', 'D', 'A'),
	x =    c(1,    3,   2),
	y =    c(0,    0,   -1)
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	M ~ A,
	D ~ A + M,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


To estimate the causal effect of marriage rate, we need to stratify
by age at marriage. Within each level of age at marriage, the 
part of the association between marriage rate and divorce rate that
is caused by age at marriage is removed. 

Stratifying by a continuous variable: every value of A produces 
a different relationship between D and M. We have a different expected
relationship. 


#### Statistical model

If we standardize (or rescale) the data, priors are easier to set for linear
models. Standardize = subtract the mean (mean of 0) and divide by the standard
deviation (sd of 1). "Since the outcome and the predictor are both standardized,
the intercept should be very close to zero. The slope beta indicates that a
change in one standard deviation in the predictor corresponds to a change in one
standard deviation in the outcome" (Page 126).


##### Prior predictive simulation  

$D_{i} \sim Normal(\mu_{i}, \sigma)$

$\mu_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{M} M_{i} + \beta_{A} A_{i}$

$\alpha \sim Normal(0, 0.2)$

$\beta_{M} \sim Normal(0, 0.5)$

$\beta_{A} \sim Normal(0, 0.5)$

$\sigma \sim Exponnential(1)$


```{r}
n <- 100
ggplot() + 
	geom_abline(aes(intercept = rnorm(n, 0, 10),
									slope = rnorm(n, 0, 10)),
							alpha = 0.1, linewidth = 2) + 
	labs(x = 'median age at marriage (standardized)', 
			 y = 'divorce rate (standardized)',
			 title = TeX(r"($\alpha \sim Normal(0, 10)$, $\beta \sim Normal(0, 10)$)")) + 
	xlim(-2, 2) + 
	ylim(-2, 2)

ggplot() + 
	geom_abline(aes(intercept = rnorm(n, 0, 0.2),
									slope = rnorm(n, 0, 0.5)),
							alpha = 0.1, linewidth = 2) +
	labs(x = 'median age at marriage (standardized)',
			 y = 'divorce rate (standardized)',
			 title = TeX(r"($\alpha \sim Normal(0, 0.2)$, $\beta \sim Normal(0, 0.5)$)")) +
	xlim(-2, 2) +
	ylim(-2, 2)
```

#### Analyze the data

The causal effect is not a function of one parameter, so
reporting simply the mean estimated parameter is often 
insufficient -  especially when considering non-linear models 
or more complicated models. 

Instead, simulate interventions. 

$p(D|do(M))$

The distribution of D when we intervene (do) on M. This is 
different than 

When we do(M), we remove all arrows into M. Using a common
set of values for A, we set different values for M and see
what difference it makes. 

1. Generate common set of values for A 
1. Set first value for M
1. Simulate for first value of M and common set of values for A
1. Set second value for M
1. Simulate for second value of M and common set of values for A
1. Compute the contrast

```{r}
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 5
g1 <- dagify(
	M ~ A,
	D ~ A + M,
	coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2) + theme_dag() + labs(title = 'no intervention') 

g2 <- dagify(
	D ~ A + M,
	coords = coords
) |>  ggdag(seed = 2) + theme_dag() + labs(title = 'do(M)') 

g1 + g2
```


What about the causal effect of A, $p(D|do(A))$?

The total causal effect of A on D requires a new model, since
M is a pipe between A and D. To estimate the causal effect of A, we need
a new model that does not include the variable M. 


## The pipe

```{r}
#| echo: false
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('X', 'Y', 'Z'),
	x =    c(1,    3,   2),
	y =    c(0,    0,   0)
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	Z ~ X,
	Y ~ Z,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```

Z is a "mediator"

- X and Y are associated ($Y \not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp X$)
- Influence of X on Y transmitted through Z
- Once stratified by Z, there will be no association ($Y \perp\!\!\!\perp X | Z$)


```{r}
n <- 1e3
X <- rbern(n, 0.5)
Z <- rbern(n, (1-X) * 0.1 + X * 0.9)
Y <- rbern(n, (1-Z) * 0.1 + Z * 0.9)

table(X, Y)
cor(X, Y)

table(X[Z == 0], Y[Z == 0])
cor(X[Z == 0], Y[Z == 0])

table(X[Z == 1], Y[Z == 1])
cor(X[Z == 1], Y[Z == 1])

```


### Example: plant growth, anti-fungal


#### Estimand

What is the causal effect of treatment (anti-fungal) on plant growth?

#### Scientific model

- H0: height at time 0
- H1: height at time 1
- F: fungus
- T: anti-fungal treatment 

```{r}
#| echo: false
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('F', 'H1', 'H0', 'T'),
	x =    c(1,    2,   3, 0),
	y =    c(0,    1,   1, 1)
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 5
dagify(
	H1 ~ H0 + F + T,
	F ~ T,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


#### Analyse the data

(Full example on pages 170-175)

The path T -> F -> H1 is a pipe. Should we stratify by F?
No. The total causal effect of treatment is blocked by the pipe through F. 

This is also called post-treatment bias. Stratifying by a consequence of the
treatment, misleading that treatment does or doesn't work. 

### Post-treatment bias

Stratifying by a consequence of the treatment induces post-treatment bias

Can mislead that the treatment doesn't work


## The collider

```{r}
#| echo: false
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('X', 'Y', 'Z'),
	x =    c(1,    3,   2),
	y =    c(0,    0,   0)
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	Z ~ X + Y,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```

Z is a "collider"

- X and Y are not associated ($Y  \perp\!\!\!\perp X$)
- Z is caused by both X and Z
- Once stratified by Z, X and Y are associated ($Y \not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp X | Z$)


```{r}
n <- 1e3
X <- rbern(n, 0.5)
Y <- rbern(n, 0.5)
Z <- rbern(n, ifelse(X + Y > 0, 0.9, 0.2))

table(X, Y)
cor(X, Y)

table(X[Z == 0], Y[Z == 0])
cor(X[Z == 0], Y[Z == 0])

table(X[Z == 1], Y[Z == 1])
cor(X[Z == 1], Y[Z == 1])
```


### Example: grant applications

```{r}
#| echo: false
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('N', 'T', 'A'),
	x =    c(1,    3,   2),
	y =    c(0,    0,   0)
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	A ~ N + T,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


Each grant application scored on newsworthiness and trustworthiness.

Grants are only awarded if sufficiently newsworthy or trustworthy. Few grants
are high in both, therefore there is a negative association between
newsworthiness and trustworthiness that arises from conditioning on 
awards. This is a post-selection sample, where the sample (eg. awards or jobs)
have already selected for features. 


### Example: age and happiness

There are post-treatment colliders like the example above and there are colliders
that are a result from the statistical processing, within the analysis. 

#### Estimand

Does age influence happiness?


#### Scientific model

Possible confound is marital status


```{r}
#| echo: false
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('H', 'A', 'M'),
	x =    c(1,    3,   2),
	y =    c(0,    0,   0)
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 3
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	M ~ A + H,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


#### Statistical model

(In the textbook on pages 176-177)


#### Analyse the data

No association between age and happiness but when stratified by marital status, 
there is a negative association between age and happiness.
