# The four elemental confounds

Correlation is common in nature, causation is sparse. 
Causes are not in the data.


![](../graphics/stat_rethinking_l05_four_elemental.png)

Recall: 

- Estimand: goal
- Estimator: recipe, instructions
- Estimate: result, may not always match estimand due to eg. confounds

Confounds are features of the sample and how we use the sample that misleads
us. Sources of confounds are diverse but there are four elemental 
confounds. 


## The fork

```{r}
#| echo: false
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('X', 'Y', 'Z'),
	x =    c(1,    3,   2),
	y =    c(0,    0,   0)
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 2
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	X ~ Z,
	Y ~ Z,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


- X and Y are associated ($Y \not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp X$)
- X and Y share common cause Z
- Once stratified by Z, there will be no association ($Y \perp\!\!\!\perp X | Z$)



$\not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp$: not independent of

$\perp\!\!\!\perp$: independent of

$|$: conditional of



```{r}
n <- 1e3
Z <- rbern(n, 0.5)
X <- rbern(n, (1-Z) * 0.1 + Z * 0.9)
Y <- rbern(n, (1-Z) * 0.1 + Z * 0.9)

table(X, Y)
cor(X, Y)
```


### Example: marriage and divorce


#### Estimand

Why do regions of the USA with higher rates of marriage also have higher
rates of divorce?


#### Scientific model

Age at marriage is also associated with divorce and marriage rates. 
Is the relationship between marriage rate and divorce rate solely
a result of the fork, their shared relationship with age at marriage? 

```{r}
#| echo: false
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('M', 'D', 'A'),
	x =    c(1,    3,   2),
	y =    c(0,    0,   -1)
)
```

```{r}
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 4 
dagify(
	M ~ A,
	D ~ A + M,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


To estimate the causal effect of marriage rate, we need to stratify
by age at marriage. Within each level of age at marriage, the 
part of the association between marriage rate and divorce rate that
is caused by age at marriage is removed. 

Stratifying by a continuous variable: every value of A produces 
a different relationship between D and M. We have a different expected
relationship. 


#### Statistical model

If we standardize (or rescale) the data, priors are easier to set for linear
models. Standardize = subtract the mean (mean of 0) and divide by the standard
deviation (sd of 1). "Since the outcome and the predictor are both standardized,
the intercept should be very close to zero. The slope beta indicates that a
change in one standard deviation in the predictor corresponds to a change in one
standard deviation in the outcome" (Page 126).


##### Prior predictive simulation  

$D_{i} \sim Normal(\mu_{i}, \sigma)$

$\mu_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{M} M_{i} + \beta_{A} A_{i}$

$\alpha \sim Normal(0, 0.2)$

$\beta_{M} \sim Normal(0, 0.5)$

$\beta_{A} \sim Normal(0, 0.5)$

$\sigma \sim Exponnential(1)$


```{r}
n <- 100
ggplot() + 
	geom_abline(aes(intercept = rnorm(n, 0, 10),
									slope = rnorm(n, 0, 10)),
							alpha = 0.1, linewidth = 2) + 
	labs(x = 'median age at marriage (standardized)', 
			 y = 'divorce rate (standardized)',
			 title = TeX(r"($\alpha \sim Normal(0, 10)$, $\beta \sim Normal(0, 10)$)")) + 
	xlim(-2, 2) + 
	ylim(-2, 2)

ggplot() + 
	geom_abline(aes(intercept = rnorm(n, 0, 0.2),
									slope = rnorm(n, 0, 0.5)),
							alpha = 0.1, linewidth = 2) +
	labs(x = 'median age at marriage (standardized)',
			 y = 'divorce rate (standardized)',
			 title = TeX(r"($\alpha \sim Normal(0, 0.2)$, $\beta \sim Normal(0, 0.5)$)")) +
	xlim(-2, 2) +
	ylim(-2, 2)
```

#### Analyze the data

The causal effect is not a function of one parameter, so
reporting simply the mean estimated parameter is often 
insufficient -  especially when considering non-linear models 
or more complicated models. 

Instead, simulate interventions. 

$p(D|do(M))$

The distribution of D when we intervene (do) on M. This is 
different than 

When we do(M), we remove all arrows into M. Using a common
set of values for A, we set different values for M and see
what difference it makes. 

1. Generate common set of values for A 
1. Set first value for M
1. Simulate for first value of M and common set of values for A
1. Set second value for M
1. Simulate for second value of M and common set of values for A
1. Compute the contrast

```{r}
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 5
g1 <- dagify(
	M ~ A,
	D ~ A + M,
	coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2) + theme_dag() + labs(title = 'no intervention') 

g2 <- dagify(
	D ~ A + M,
	coords = coords
) |>  ggdag(seed = 2) + theme_dag() + labs(title = 'do(M)') 

g1 + g2
```


What about $p(D|do(A))$?

Total causal effect of A on D requires a new model, since
M is a pipe between A and D.
