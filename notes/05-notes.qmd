# The four elemental confounds

Correlation is common in nature, causation is sparse


Recall: 

- Estimand: goal
- Estimator: recipe, instructions
- Estimate: result, may not always match estimand due to eg. confounds

Confounds are features of the sample and how we use the sample that misleads
us. Sources of confounds are diverse but there are four elemental 
confounds. 

Causes are not in the data.
