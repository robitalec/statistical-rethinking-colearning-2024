# Correlated features

One prior distribution for each cluster

1. One feature: one-dimensional distribution, eg. a varying intercepts ($\alpha_{j} \sim Normal(\bar{\alpha}, \sigma)$)
1. Two features: two-dimensional distribution, ideally not two 1-D distributions but one 2-D distribution ($[\alpha_{j}, \beta_{j}] \sim MVNormal([\bar{\alpha}, \bar{\beta}], \sum)$)
1. N features: N-dimensional distribution ($[\alpha_{j, 1...N}] \sim MVNormal(A, \sum)$)


Correlated varying effects take priors that learn correlation structure
using partial pooling across features. 


## Model specification

$[\alpha_{j}, \beta_{j}] \sim MVNormal([\bar{\alpha}, \bar{\beta}], R, [\sigma, \tau])$

- $[\alpha_{j}, \beta_{j}]$: features for district j
- $MVNormal$
	- $[\bar{\alpha}, \bar{\beta}]$: feature means
	- $R$: correlation matrix
	- $[\sigma, \tau])$: standard deviations

$R \sim LKJCorr(4)$

The LKJ prior is a prior distribution for correlations

```{r}
alpha_bar <- 0
beta_bar <- 10
mu <- c(alpha_bar, beta_bar)

rho <- -0.8
R <- matrix(c(1, rho, rho, 1), 2, 2)

n <- 100
mvnorm_prior <- rmvnorm(n, mu, sigma = R)

ggplot(data.frame(mvnorm_prior), aes(X1, X2)) + 
	geom_point() + 
	stat_ellipse(level = .89) + 
	labs(x = 'alpha', y = 'beta') + 
	theme_bw()
```



## Example: Bangladesh fertility survey

Outcome: contraceptive use

Variables: age, living children, urban/rural, districts

```{r}
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 4 

coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('A', 'C', 'D', 'K', 'U'),
	x =    c(1,    2,    3,   1.5, 2.5),
	y =    c(0,    0.5,    0,  -1, -1)
)
dagify(
	C ~ A + K + D + U,
	K ~ A + U,
	U ~ D,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```

From the previous lecture, the varying intercepts for district and slopes 
for urban. 

$C_{i} \sim Bernoulli(D_{i}, p_{i})$

$logit(p_{i}) = \alpha_{D[i]} + \beta_{D[i]}U_{i}$

$\alpha_{j} = \bar{\alpha} + Z_{\alpha, j} * \sigma$

$\beta_{j} = \bar{\beta} + Z_{\beta, j} * \sigma$

$Z_{\alpha, j} \sim Normal(0, 1)$

$Z_{\beta, j} \sim Normal(0, 1)$

$\bar{\alpha}, \bar{\beta} \sim Normal(0, 1)$

$\sigma, \tau \sim  Exponential(1)$

There is useful information to transfer across features, here we note there
is a correlation between rural and urban probability of use within districts. 
A model that uses two 1-dimensional distributions (intercepts and slopes) does
not consider the covariance structure between rural and urban within district. 

Comparing the centered and non-centered model specification for the model
using the multivariate normal specification with correlated features.

Simulating synthetic data for this kind of complex system is challenging
and is likely best done with more detailed tools than eg. expecting a linear
responses, instead with eg. an agent based model.


# Divergent transitions

Because of high curvature, the physics simulation runs off the surface. 
One option is to choose a smaller step size, but this results in much 
longer sampling time. Alternatively, re-express the "centered" model
as a "non-centered" model.
