# Social networks

Social network are patterns of directed exchange. Social networks 
are abstractions, not data. 

Social relationships are latent variables, they cannot be directly
observed but the behaviours that contribute to them can be. 

Relationships are paired, eg. A to B and B to A, and either of these
can motivate behaviours. These relationships don't have to be 
symmetrical, eg. A may perceive their relationship with B as 
stronger than B does.
