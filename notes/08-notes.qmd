# Markov chain Monte Carlo

- Chain: sequence of draws from distribution
- Markov chain: history doesn't matter, just current location
- Monte Carlo: some numerical algorithm that uses random simulation


Use in Bayesian statistics: to draw samples from a distribution

Sample each parameter value in proportion to its probability

There can be any number of dimensions (parameters)

At every step, the comparison is between the current combination of parameter
values, and the candidate combination of parameter values. In this way, 
we don't need to evaluate the entire grid
