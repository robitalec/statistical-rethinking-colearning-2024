## Directed acyclic graphs

Statistical models process data but to provide insight, we require scientific
models. Causes of data cannot be extracted alone using a statistical model, we
need causal models.

Causal inference is the prediction of intervention and imputation of missing
observations.

Causal prediction: knowing a cause means being able to predict the consequences
of an intervention. Causal imputation: knowing a cause means being able to
construct unobserved counterfactual outcomes.


```{r 01_dag, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggdag))
ggdag(dagify(
  Y ~ X + C + B,
  X ~ A + C,
  exposure = 'X',
  outcome = 'Y'
), seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```

- X is a treatment
- Y is an outcome
- B is a competing cause of Y
- A is an influence of the treatment X
- C is a common cause of X and Y (a confound)

Relationships between *all* variables can impact outcomes. 


::: {.callout-note}
At one moment in time, DAGs are unidirectional. With a time series, 
you can have reciprocal relationships. 
:::


DAGs are not specific to one model and therefore can be used for different
queries and related models. These different models should not necessarily
include all variables, and DAGs help us determine good and bad controls
for each question. DAGs are logically specific and can be used to test and 
refine the causal model. 

::: {.callout-note}
How do we justify controls in eg. the relationship between X and Y?

1. We need a DAG
1. then we analyse it to determine the adjustment set

Statistical models are powerful but dangerous and have no wisdom or foresight. 
Flowcharts of tests that are isolated for specific uses are not intuitive or 
appropriate for research science. Null hypothesis rejection is not 
appropriate, feasible or ethical in many contexts.

What are other process models that are consistent with this same fact?

Emphasis on documenting and testing code, using a *respectable* workflow

1. Theoretical estimand
1. Scientific (causal) model
1. Use the theoretical estimand and the scientific model to build a statistical
model
1. Simulate from the scientific model to validate that the statistical model 
yields the theoretical estimand
1. Analyse the real data
